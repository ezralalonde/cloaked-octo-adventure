A short program that will "swap" train cars until it is ordered.

Reads input, swaps adjacent train places and pronts the optimal number of swaps to order all cars on the train.

The first line of input N is the number of trains to be read.

For each of the N trains, two further lines of input are read.
    - A number C that is the length of the train
    - C different integers, representing the train cars

Adjacent cars will be swapped until the the train cars are sorted according to their integer values.

There will be M lines of output, each representing the swaps performed.
